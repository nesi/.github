## NeSI Integration with REANNZ

On 01 July 2025, New Zealand eScience Infrastructure (NeSI) was integrated into the Crown company, Research and Education Advanced Network New Zealand (REANNZ) Ltd.

NeSI’s services and technologies are now hosted by REANNZ as a national [eResearch Infrastructure Platform](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/science-and-technology/science-and-innovation/funding-information-and-opportunities/investment-funds/strategic-science-investment-fund/funded-infrastructure/eresearch-infrastructure-platform).

Some of our tools (e.g. [my.nesi.org.nz](https://my.nesi.org.nz/login)) will retain a ‘NeSI’ brand as we transition our services and develop a longer-term strategy for this integrated platform.
